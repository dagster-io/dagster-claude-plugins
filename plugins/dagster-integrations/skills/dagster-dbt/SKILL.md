# dagster-dbt Integration

The dagster-dbt integration represents dbt models as Dagster assets, enabling granular orchestration
at the individual model level.

## Why Use This Integration

- Run and track individual dbt models, seeds, and snapshots as separate assets
- Schedule dbt models alongside other data tools (Python, Spark, etc.)
- Define dependencies between dbt models and other Dagster assets
- Use Dagster's UI to monitor dbt model runs, failures, and logs
- Leverage Dagster's asset selection syntax to run subsets of your dbt project

## Two Integration Approaches

### Component-Based (Recommended)

Configure dbt integration via YAML using `DbtProjectComponent`. This is a StateBackedComponent that
automatically compiles and caches your dbt manifest.

- Minimal code, YAML-first configuration
- Supports both colocated and external Git-based dbt projects
- Automatic state management for manifest compilation
- See [Component-Based Integration](references/component-based-integration.md) for details

### Pythonic

Programmatic integration using the `@dbt_assets` decorator for full control over asset definitions.

- Maximum flexibility for complex customization
- Explicit Python code for all configuration
- Direct access to dbt CLI and manifest
- See [Pythonic Integration](references/pythonic-integration.md) for details

## dbt Cloud Integration

The integration also supports dbt Cloud projects via the v2 API. See
[dbt Cloud Integration](references/dbt-cloud.md) for details.

## Key Concepts

- **dbt manifest**: Compiled representation of all dbt models, tests, sources, and relationships
- **Asset checks**: dbt tests are loaded as Dagster asset checks by default
- **State management**: For Component approach, see general
  [StateBackedComponents](../integrations-index/references/state-backed-components.md) pattern
- **Translation**: Customize how dbt nodes map to Dagster assets via `get_asset_spec()` method or
  YAML config
